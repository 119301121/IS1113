		<h1>Achievements</h1>
			<p>My team came second in the inaugural MedTech Challenge in UCC on the 21st of February 2020 - we had one day to prepare a solution presented to us by a panel of judges. Working with both medical research, implementing technology and a business plan to our solution which we had to present and defend in front of the judges. </p>

			<p>I was chosen as CEO for our Transition Year mini company, this helped me develop skills like leadership, communication and conflict resolution. It also helped me gain confidence and develop the skills necessary to help customers and communicate comfortably with anybody whether they were a friend, teammate, customer or someone I’ve just met. </p>

			<p>I became a Digital Safety Ambassador for McAfee where we were trained on how to give an age appropriate talk about internet safety to younger students in primary school and even the younger years in our secondary school. This really helped with basic IT, improvisation and public speaking skills as I had to quickly adapt to new environments where schools may not have had a working projector, or sound which meant I had to work with whatever prep sheets/flashcards I had on hand. </p>

			<p>I was a member of Comhairle na nOg in Cork City, our main objective was to introduce legislation which would allow for young people from the age of 16 to be trained for SafeTalk which has been proven to improve the mental health of young people who have come across the program – following in the footsteps of other European countries.</p>
